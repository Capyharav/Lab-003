# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

_Width is an issue - should just be length or width. Chinese has billion speakers, which makes it misleading to read. Image on the side is dodgy and stereotypical, slightly racist._





## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

_Sections popping in and out for no reason. Not labelled informatively. Black and white harder to distinguish, not very accessible._




## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

_Rule of law not descriptive. Hard to distinguish bubbles. Labels aren't clear._




## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

_why are the countries ordered on top of each other. Area is hard to read and understand. Compound graph is confusing._





# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

what is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?
In wide, there are more variables than observations, in long there are less variables than observations. 

Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?
-Wide

How many observations are there in the data set?
-55



## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

#staff_long <- ___ %>%
#  ___(
#    cols = ____, 
#    names_to = "_____",
#    values_to = "percent"
#    )

```

```

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}
